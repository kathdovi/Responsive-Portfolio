                Hello! I am a senior linguistics major at UT Austin. I am currently in the UT Austin full stack bootcamp because I found
                my passion for code a little too late. Along with web development, I also have skills and experience working
                in Python and Java. I have also worked in Ruby and Rust, and I learn quickly and am always eager for new
                knowledge. Challenges excite me, and I am always up for a puzzle! Additionally, I have some experience with
                design and graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I like to read, play guitar and sing, learn new languages, and encourage political engagement. Currently, I am the communications
                director for University Democrats at UT Austin, so I run our twitter (@UDems... follow us) and make memes
                to make students aware of deadlines to register to vote and election days. I also respond to media requests
                and manage other social media outlets. Before college, I was in a band that played at a festival among the
                ranks of Joan Jett and Cheap Trick. I speak English, French, German, Norwegian, and some Spanish. I'm also an avid traveller and have visited 27 countries -- that's 6
                more than my age.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduation, I hope to get a job in full-stack or front-end web development. I am seeking employment starting summer
                2019. I would be best suited to work somewhere that values creativity and progressive values and is not afraid
                to expect great things from their new employees. I'm ready to start doing good work for some good people!
